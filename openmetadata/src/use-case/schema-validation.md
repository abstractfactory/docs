### Schema Validation

Use of Open Metadata to define Schemas, similar to [https://github.com/chadrik/schema](https://github.com/chadrik/schema).

Defining a Schema commonly involves persistently storing a key, value plus type-definition for each value. As Open Metadata defines a vast array of static types, these could be used as a means of defining a fixed schema for use in e.g. communications protocols.
