### Sandbox is Love

```
shot5
	marcus
		software.workspace
```

Once software has been registered and installed into your folder, artists can start using them from Dashboard.

1. Pop up Dashboard
2. Enter into a folder, e.g. `shot2`
3. Hover your cursor at the bottom of a column and hit the `add` button
4. Select `notepad` to add this workspace to `shot2`

### Simple

Well done! Now let's run our software from our workspace.
