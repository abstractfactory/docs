### Configuration

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/vzut7lnj7k0zpp7/configuration_comic.png)

To configure Pipi, you need Pipi.

Sort of a chicken'n'egg problem, I'm sure you agree. What I meant to say was; to configure Pipi you need a part of Pipi known as `About` followed closely by `Dashboard`

* [`guide` Setting up About](../setting-up-about)
* [`guide` Setting up Dashboard](../setting-up-dashboard)

Awesome. Now let us embark upon tailoring Pipi to suit `you`. The following guides are meant to be followed in the order given, but you are adventurous and daring. What happens next is out of my control.

* [`guide` Registering software](../registering-software)
* [`guide` Running Software](../running-software)
* [`guide` Adding a new workspace](../adding-new-workspace)
* [`guide` Adding software](../adding-software)
* [`guide` Configuring Software](../configuring-software)
* [`guide` Non-available software](../non-available-software)

There are a few things missing from this release, this page should fill you in and let you know in on which walls to start climbing.

* [`reference` Missing funcationality](../missing)
