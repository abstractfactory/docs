#### Warm and fuzzy

We encourage contributions to Pipi. If you'd like to contribute, you'll need a [GitHub][github] account and an invitation to join our [GitHub Organisation][org].

Let me know this is of interest to you, and we'll talk.

# Fork, submit pull-request

That sums up the gist of our collaboration. As for style guidelines, [the usergroup][usergroup] would be an excellent place to get some of those put into black and white.
