### Installing `Python`

It is assumed you already have `Python` on your system. However, for completeness, here are the installation instructions.

1. Install [`Windows X86-64 MSI Installer (2.7.6)`][python]

### Come with me if you want to live

Although optional for the purposes of this guide and usage of Pipi, Python is the most useful if it is accessible via your terminal.

```
$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Nov 10 2013, 19:24:24) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

To make it so, you need to educate your environment about it.

See [Adding Python to your `PATH`][PATH] for more details.
