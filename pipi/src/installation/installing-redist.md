### Installing `redist`

Pipi is utilising a graphical user interface framework called `PyQt5`. This framework comes pre-compiled with this installation and if you would like to use this version you will also want to get the re-distributable for Visual C++ 2012; otherwise, it won't play along.

1. Go to [`redist`][redist]
2. Hit "Download" and pick a version compatible with your system. If you are unsure, pick `VSU_4\vcredist_x64.exe`
3. Download
4. Install
