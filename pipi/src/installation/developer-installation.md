### Developer Installation

#### Kudos, you chose the way of the cool kids.

Either have a look at some videos, or follow the instructions below.

* [`video` Preparing Windows][Preparing Windows]
* [`video` Installing `Pipi`][Installing with setup_pipi.py]

# Installing with `setup_pipi.py`

### Convention

These are some of the conventions used throughout this and other guides. When you see these characters preceeding what may appear as code, here is what they are asking of you:

* `$` - Anything coming after me, is meant to be run from a terminal/command prompt..
* `>>>` - ..whereas this is meant to be run from a Python interpreter.
* `./` - Refers to your installation path, most likely c:\python27\lib\site-packages
* `# ` - This is a comment

For example, to run Python from the installation directory and then import something, I would type:

```
$ ./python
>>> import this
# That wasn't too hard, was it?
```

### Moving on

It is assumed that you are running either Windows 7 or 8. Linux and OSX version are important, but not included in this release. If you already have the VS2012 redistributable, Python, pip and git set up, you can skip to [5 - Installing pipi](../installing-pipi)
