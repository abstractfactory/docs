#### You made it! Glad to have you here, let's get started.

We are **Abstract Factory** and we're building the world's greatest **Digital Asset Management System** called **Pipi**.

The beta you've got your cursor under is the first step in this great journey, and in this video, I'll walk you through this guide in one fell swoop with the intention, not that you follow along, but that you get a taste of what lies ahead.

When you're all juiced up, let's carry on.

### About

#### The right tool for the metajob

About is a front-end for Open Metadata.

Open Metadata is about associating metadata to folders on your file-system and is what is used throughout Pipi for both configuration and user-metadata such as shot descriptions or asset relationships.
